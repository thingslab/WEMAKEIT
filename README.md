# WEMAKEIT

WEMAKEIT is an open-source educational toolkit for schools and educators designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice in electronics and programming. The project provides a reusable hardware kit and a comprehensive set of experiments and projects that help students learn hands-on concepts, develop problem-solving skills, and express creativity.

What WEMAKEIT provides:

- A compact, school-friendly hardware platform (the WEMAKEIT module) and companion components suitable for classroom use.
- Curated experiments that cover fundamentals (sensors, actuators, displays), connectivity (WiFi/BLE), and project-based learning (games, data loggers, robotics).
- Clear lesson sequences and teaching strategies to help instructors guide students from basic exercises to capstone projects.
- Open-source lesson materials, schematics, and example code — free to adapt and redistribute under permissive licensing.

Why WEMAKEIT matters:

WEMAKEIT helps students connect classroom theory to real-world practice by enabling hands-on experiments that reinforce concepts in physics, electronics, and embedded programming. The kit encourages creative exploration and iterative learning, preparing students for further study or careers in STEM fields.
